title: Jeevan hi Andolan hai / life is movement itself
---
"Andolan" can mean 'movement' as well as 'protest' - life is a protest against the forces that be.
This view of life is so much better than "one must imagine sisyphus happy" and 
"the horrors persist, but so do I" that circle the internet.
Imagining, persisting are not as strong and as exciting as protesting. Protesting feels revolutionary, imagining feels like something an arm-chair philosopher would do.
Protesting inspires me to see the end of the day when I wake up, imagining makes me want to sleep again and dream.
